Abstract. 
Trust 
is 
a 
concept 
from 
everyones 
lives, 
which 
inuences 
many 
important 
choices, 
such 
as 
which 
articles 
to 
purchase 
and 
from 
whom. 
In 
this 
article 
the 
classical 
concept 
of 
trust 
is 
evaluated 
and 
applie
d 
to 
the 
world 
wide 
web. 
A 
broad 
reection 
on 
how 
trust 
is 
used 
on 
the 
web 
is 
given, 
and 
special 
attention 
is 
paid 
to 
how 
personalized 
recommendation
s 
can 
be 
given 
using 
trust 
modeling. 
This 
last 
question 
is 
evaluated 
to 
reach 
several 
research 
questions 
that 
could 
be 
used 
as 
startin
g 
point 
for 
new 
research. 
Furthermore 
suggestions 
are 
done 
on 
how 
to 
answer 
the 
formulated 
questions. 


1 
Introduction 


Trust 
is 
an 
everyday 
concept. 
People 
trust 
their 
families, 
their 
friends 
and 
their 
colleagues 
in 
what 
they 
say 
or 
advise. 
People 
also 
tend 
to 
trust 
books, 
news 
media
, 
or 
other 
public 
available 
information. 
This 
trust 
in 
others, 
and 
the 
advice 
that 
is 
given 
from 
a 
trusted 
source, 
inuences 
many 
economic 
decisions, 
such 
as 
which 
store 
to 
buy 
from, 
which 
stock 
options 
to 
take 
or 
which 
person 
to 
hire 
for 
a 
new 
job. 
This 
makes 
trust 
and 
determining 
what 
makes 
a 
source 
trustworthy 
important 
concepts 
to 
research. 


With 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
world 
wide 
web 
(WWW) 
a 
new 
source 
for 
informatio
n 
and 
advice 
was 
created. 
Especially 
after 
the 
emergence 
of 
Web 
2.0 
and 
user-generated 
content 
people 
had 
access 
to 
the 
opinions 
and 
advice 
of 
many 
others, 
which 
they 
would 
previously 
not 
have 
known. 
While 
previously 
people 
would 
have 
known 
these 
others 
because 
they 
shared 
an 
activity 
or 
a 
friend, 
the 
WWW 
provides 
no 
such 
reference, 
as 
information 
and 
user-generated 
reviews 
can 
be 
found 
after 
a 
search 
for 
the 
item 
or 
activity 
that 
is 
being 
considered. 
In 
the 
semantic 
web 
several 
parties 
can 
generate 
dierent 
or 
even 
contradicting 
information, 
making 
the 
question 
of 
what 
authors 
to 
trust 
even 
more 
important 
for 
nding 
the 
right 
information. 


1.1 
Current 
use 
of 
trust 
on 
the 
web 
Currently 
trust 
is 
an 
important 
concept 
when 
browsing 
the 
web. 
On 
the 
technica
l 
side 
public 
key 
infrastructure 
is 
used 
to 
authenticate 
websites 
and 
to 
signal 



to 
users 
that 
the 
website 
they 
visit 
can 
be 
trusted. 
This 
all 
depends 
on 
a 
shared 
trust 
in 
certicate 
authorities 
that 
gets 
propagated 
to 
websites 
whose 
certicates 
they 
sign. 
This 
trust 
serves 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
authenticity 
rather 
than 
a 
measure 
of 
quality. 


Less 
technical 
and 
more 
information-oriented, 
trust 
also 
serves 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
quality 
for 
information.[1] 
Trust 
in 
this 
sense 
can 
be 
indicated 
in 
multiple 
ways, 
for 
example 
by 
other 
sources 
referring 
to 
high-quality 
information 
sources 
by 
citing 
it 
or 
linking 
towards 
it. 
In 
a 
sense 
this 
is 
equal 
to 
a 
good 
reputation, 
as 
already 
used 
by 
algorithms 
like 
Google 
Pagerank. 
When 
this 
information 
concern
s 
reviews 
or 
comments 
posted 
by 
other 
users, 
websites 
can 
use 
rating 
systems 
to 
determine 
the 
best 
contributions. 
Two 
examples 
of 
this 
are 
the 
rating 
system 
of 
the 
IMDB, 
going 
from 
one 
star 
to 
ten 
stars, 
to 
compute 
an 
average 
ranking 
of 
contributions, 
or 
the 
ranking 
system 
for 
Amazon 
product 
reviews: 
"120 
of 
200 
people 
found 
the 
following 
review 
helpful". 
In 
these 
examples, 
giving 
a 
high 
ranking 
to 
a 
movie 
or 
signaling 
you 
found 
a 
review 
helpful 
is 
an 
implicit 
expressio
n 
of 
trust 
towards 
the 
source 
of 
the 
review. 


More 
high-level, 
trust 
is 
used 
by 
websites 
to 
compel 
users 
to 
share 
their 
persona
l 
details; 
most 
users 
will 
not 
reveal 
personal 
data 
to 
websites, 
unless 
they 
trust 
the 
supplier 
of 
that 
website 
and 
trust 
him 
to 
respect 
their 
privacy 
and 
keep 
their 
information 
safe.[2] 


Finally 
trust 
is 
connected 
to 
website 
design. 
When 
dealing 
with 
an 
unknown 
vendor 
or 
website 
users 
have 
to 
determine 
whether 
they 
trust 
this 
vendor 
in 
the 
time 
they 
browse 
that 
vendors 
website 
before 
making 
their 
rst 
purchase.[3] 
In 
this 
sense, 
trust 
can 
be 
generated 
by 
a 
good 
appearance 
and 
initial 
interactions. 


As 
the 
main 
contribution 
of 
this 
article, 
research 
questions 
will 
be 
formulated 
focused 
on 
the 
following 
question: 
How 
to 
model 
trust 
in 
a 
way 
that 
allows 
for 
accurate 
recommendations? 
To 
this 
purpose 
the 
remainder 
of 
this 
article 
proceed
s 
as 
follows. 
Section 
2 
discusses 
how 
to 
model 
trust 
relations 
on 
the 
web 
and 
what 
decisions 
have 
to 
be 
made. 
Section 
3 
then 
discusses 
related 
work 
and 
questions 
that 
have 
already 
been 
answered. 
Section 
4 
formulates 
several 
research 
questions 
that 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
answered, 
and 
gives 
a 
short 
discussion 
on 
how 
to 
perform 
the 
needed 
research. 
Finally 
section 
5 
provides 
a 
short 
conclusion 
about 
trust 
on 
the 
web 
and 
the 
questions 
still 
left 
unanswered. 


2 
Trust 
modeling 


Where 
the 
previous 
section 
discussed 
how 
trust 
is 
used, 
this 
section 
focuses 
more 
on 
the 
concept 
of 
trust, 
provididing 
a 
denition 
and 
several 
aspects 
of 
trust 
that 
need 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
for 
an 
accurate 
model. 



2.1 
Aspects 
of 
trust 
The 
oxford 
english 
dictionary 
gives 
the 
following 
denition 
of 
trust: 
A 
rm 
belief 
in 
the 
reliability, 
truth, 
or 
ability 
of 
someone 
or 
something.[4] 
Based 
on 
this 
denition 
four 
aspects 
of 
trust 
can 
already 
be 
identied. 


– 
Trust 
requires 
two 
parties. 
Every 
trust 
relation 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
someone 
or 
something 
that 
is 
trusted, 
and 
someone 
or 
something 
to 
do 
the 
trusting. 
As 
such, 
trust 
is 
the 
relationship 
t(a, 
b), 
meaning 
that 
a 
trusts 
b 
to 
some 
extent. 
– 
Trust 
is 
asymmetrical. 
The 
given 
denition 
doesn't 
specify 
a 
reciprocal 
relation. 
Person 
a 
can 
trust 
person 
b 
without 
b 
also 
trusting 
a. 
– 
Trust 
needs 
a 
context. 
When 
believing 
in 
the 
ability 
of 
someone, 
it 
concerns 
a 
specic 
area 
of 
ability. 
A 
can 
trust 
b 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
economic 
decisions, 
but 
this 
does 
not 
imply 
that 
a 
has 
the 
same 
trust 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
moral 
decisions. 
– 
Trust 
has 
a 
rmness. 
The 
rmess 
of 
the 
belief 
reects 
to 
what 
extent 
a 
person 
or 
thing 
is 
trusted. 
This 
can 
be 
modeled 
using 
a 
weight 
which 
can 
be 
either 
discrete 
or 
continuous. 
2.2 
Modeling 
decisions 
The 
aspects 
of 
trust 
already 
mentioned 
above 
give 
an 
outline 
for 
modeling 
trust, 
and 
based 
upon 
those 
aspects 
trust 
can 
be 
modeled 
as 
a 
directed 
weighted 
graph. 
However, 
it 
still 
leaves 
several 
questions 
unanswered, 
which 
need 
to 
be 
decided 
upon 
for 
any 
complete 
modeling 
of 
trust. 


– 
To 
what 
extent 
is 
trust 
timebound? 
Trust 
in 
a 
certain 
person 
or 
thing 
hasn't 
always 
existed. 
Policies 
of 
companies 
can 
change 
and 
so 
can 
the 
trust 
in 
them. 
People 
change 
over 
the 
years 
and 
so 
will 
their 
preferences. 
This 
makes 
trust 
inherently 
timebound. 
– 
Is 
trust 
fully 
transitive? 
When 
a 
trusts 
b, 
and 
b 
trusts 
c, 
will 
a 
consequently 
also 
trust 
c? 
How 
is 
a 
propagation 
of 
trust 
modeled 
to 
properly 
reect 
reality? 
– 
How 
to 
model 
distrust? 
Is 
distrust 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
rmness 
of 
the 
belief? 
In 
this 
sense, 
distrust 
can 
be 
modeled 
by 
a 
negative 
number 
or 
by 
a 
zero. 
Can 
it 
be 
handled 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
trust, 
or 
is 
it 
less 
transitive 
or 
timebound? 
Can 
person 
a 
both 
trust 
and 
distrust 
person 
b, 
each 
in 
dierent 
amounts?

Related 
work 


Many 
important 
contributions 
have 
already 
been 
made 
to 
the 
eld 
of 
trust 
modeling
, 
some 
originating 
from 
the 
social 
sciences 
and 
some 
more 
from 
the 
viewpoin
t 
of 
recommender 
systems. 
It 
was 
already 
shown 
by 
[5] 
that 
people 
rely 
more 
on 
recommendations 
from 
trusted 
parties, 
than 
on 
recommendations 
done 
automaticall
y 
by 
a 
recommender 
system, 
clearly 
indicating 
the 
need 
for 
this 
research 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
the 
WWW. 
An 
extensive 
survey 
is 
done 
by 
[1], 
dening 
four 



broad 
areas 
of 
how 
trust 
is 
used 
in 
computing 
and 
on 
the 
web: 
policy-based, 
reputation-based, 
creating 
general 
models, 
and 
trust 
in 
information 
resources. 
The 
third 
and 
fourth 
area 
are 
mostly 
considered 
for 
this 
article. 


In 
[3] 
the 
impact 
of 
initial 
interactions 
with 
a 
website 
on 
trust 
is 
evaluated, 
showing 
that 
website 
quality 
and 
reputation 
are 
important 
factors 
in 
determinin
g 
initial 
trust. 
Furthermore 
in 
[2] 
trust 
and 
privacy 
concerns 
of 
users 
are 
researche
d 
when 
considering 
to 
reveal 
personal 
information, 
concluding 
that 
most 
people 
are 
very 
hesitant 
to 
reveal 
personal 
information 
to 
untrusted 
websites. 


For 
the 
transitivity 
of 
trust 
and 
the 
modeling 
of 
distrust, 
[6] 
provides 
several 
models 
of 
propagating 
trust 
and 
distrust 
and 
evaluates 
these 
models 
on 
a 
large 
test-set. 
This 
shows 
that 
trust 
is 
more 
important 
than 
distrust 
to 
propagate, 
but 
that 
adding 
distrust 
in 
the 
model 
signicantly 
improves 
the 
accuracy. 
Finally 
[7] 
discusses 
recommendations 
and 
suggests 
promising 
models 
for 
recommendations 
based 
on 
trust 
and 
distrust 
expressions. 
While 
these 
models 
provides 
a 
small 
increas
e 
in 
accuracy 
over 
purely 
content-based 
recommendations, 
the 
results 
are 
not 
signicant 
enough 
to 
provide 
an 
important 
step 
forward. 


4 
Research 
questions 


To 
come 
to 
a 
succesful 
recommender 
system 
based 
on 
trust 
modeling, 
the 
questio
n 
needs 
to 
be 
answered 
how 
to 
accurately 
recommend 
based 
on 
trust, 
and 
for 
what 
purposes. 
A 
clear 
example 
of 
a 
purpose 
for 
which 
a 
trust-based 
recommendatio
n 
would 
be 
useful 
is 
when 
viewing 
reviews 
for 
an 
item 
or 
activity 
that 
is 
considered 
for 
purchasing. 
The 
question 
how 
to 
recommend 
based 
on 
trust 
can 
be 
further 
evaluated 
by 
answering 
the 
following 
research 
questions: 


– 
How 
to 
accurately 
recommend 
based 
on 
trust? 
1. 
What 
metrics 
can 
be 
used 
to 
determine 
the 
trust 
a 
party 
a 
has 
in 
b? 
2. 
How 
can 
distrust 
best 
be 
modeled 
to 
increase 
the 
accuracy 
of 
recommende
r 
systems? 
3. 
How 
can 
context-specic 
trust 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
for 
general 
recommende
r 
systems? 
Research 
question 
(1) 
is 
relevant 
because 
trust 
can 
be 
expressed 
in 
many 
ways. 
On 
twitter 
a 
person 
can 
'follow’ 
another 
person, 
but 
does 
this 
indicate 
trust, 
and 
if 
so, 
how 
much? 
When 
a 
review 
on 
Amazon 
is 
labeled 
as 
'Not 
helpful', 
does 
that 
indicate 
indierence 
or 
distrust? 
Dening 
and 
evaluating 
metrics 
for 
trust 
seems 
an 
important 
step 
to 
come 
to 
a 
recommender 
system. 


For 
researching 
question 
(1) 
a 
specic 
domain 
will 
have 
to 
be 
chosen. 
On 
each 
website 
users 
can 
express 
trust 
in 
dierent 
ways, 
so 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
research 
will 
be 
limited 
to 
the 
platforms 
under 
evaluation, 
possibly 
ending 
at 
some 
global 
conclusions 
that 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
other 
similar 
platforms. 
The 
methodology 
can 
use 
cross-verication 
by, 
for 
example, 
calculating 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
user 



would 
get 
his 
current 
behavior 
recommended, 
without 
taking 
that 
specic 
curren
t 
behaviour 
into 
account 
for 
the 
calculation. 


Research 
question 
(2) 
is 
focused 
on 
a 
topic 
that 
[6] 
already 
partially 
answered, 
but 
remains 
nonetheless 
relevant. 
First 
o, 
the 
results 
from 
2004 
can 
be 
outdated 
as 
the 
use 
of 
the 
web 
can 
have 
evolved 
since 
then, 
and 
a 
more 
recent 
evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
distrust 
on 
recommendations, 
based 
on 
the 
same 
datasource, 
failed 
to 
provide 
conclusive 
results.[7] 
Secondly 
and 
more 
importantly, 
the 
model 
was 
only 
provided 
for 
epinions.com 
and 
was 
not 
evaluated 
on 
other 
sources, 
possibly 
limiting 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
research. 


For 
researching 
this 
question 
the 
same 
methodology 
used 
by 
[6] 
can 
be 
taken 
to 
conrm 
their 
results 
on 
a 
more 
recent 
dataset. 
If 
available, 
it 
can 
also 
be 
applie
d 
to 
datasets 
originating 
from 
other 
sources, 
to 
conclude 
which 
of 
the 
ndings 
are 
specic 
to 
epinions.com 
and 
which 
seem 
to 
hold 
in 
general. 


Finally 
research 
question 
(3) 
is 
not 
addressed 
by 
current 
research 
yet. 
Search 
engines 
such 
as 
Google 
provide 
personalized 
search 
results, 
for 
which 
a 
trust-based 
improvement 
can 
possibly 
be 
made. 
Here 
it 
becomes 
important 
to 
model 
in 
which 
context 
it 
holds 
that 
a 
trusts 
b, 
and 
to 
dierentiate 
results 
based 
on 
the 
context. 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
semantic 
web 
has 
an 
important 
contribution, 
as 
it 
can 
more 
easily 
provide 
context 
for 
information. 


To 
research 
this, 
rst 
a 
model 
needs 
to 
be 
developed 
for 
taking 
the 
context 
into 
account 
when 
determining 
trust. 
Depending 
on 
the 
envisioned 
model 
several 
tests 
can 
be 
done 
on 
user 
behavior 
in 
search 
engines, 
comparing 
their 
favoured 
results 
to 
the 
results 
suggested 
by 
revised 
recommender 
systems 
that 
take 
the 
new 
model 
into 
account. 


5 
Conclusions 


The 
conceptual 
notion 
of 
trust 
was 
evaluated 
and 
compared 
to 
how 
it 
is 
used 
on 
the 
web. 
Especially 
distrust 
and 
context 
were 
identied 
as 
unsolved 
issues 
in 
digital 
trust, 
and 
three 
research 
questions 
were 
formulated 
as 
a 
starting 
point 
for 
further 
research. 
While 
the 
modeling 
of 
distrust 
and 
deciding 
on 
platform-specic 
metrics 
for 
trust 
can 
be 
more 
easily 
answered, 
using 
context-specic 
trust 
in 
general 
recommender 
engines 
might 
prove 
more 
complex 
and 
can 
remain 
an 
interesting 
eld 
of 
research 
for 
the 
next 
few 
years.
