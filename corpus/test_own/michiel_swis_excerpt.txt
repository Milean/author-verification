A possible solution is to use the document creation or modification date to describe an atomic time interval, a chronon, at which the information at hand was valid. When more clearly identified events (\Today scientists at CERN may have found the Higgs-Boson") are generated, automated reasoning can determine the certainty of the first statement changes. For event extraction the unstructured text first needs to be parsed using a syntactic parser to detect semantic roles for verbs contained in the text.[4] Then in the second step the temporal attributes of each sentence need to be classified, to properly detect types of events.[5] The tense of the sentence is important to classify when the event is, the modality describes whether it is something that happened, should happen, can happen or will not happen. And most important the event class needs to be identified, whether it concerns an action, an occurrance, a perception or another class, to properly give an event a semantic annotation. Then in the third step the temporal relation between two events needs to be chosen. Representing these time intervals will more thoroughly be discussed in the next section.
