Abstract. 
Our 
daily 
lives 
are 
shaped 
by 
being 
on 
time 
in 
meetings, 
reporting 
time 
spent 
for 
dierent 
tasks, 
and 
revising 
theories 
we 
held 
yesterday, 
based 
on 
new 
information 
we 
were 
presented 
with 
today. 
On 
the 
semantic 
web 
the 
information 
and 
relations 
are 
not 
much 
dierent, 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
many 
of 
them 
have 
an 
implicit 
temporal 
component. 
In 
the 
current 
semantic 
web 
not 
many 
relationships 
make 
this 
temporal 
component 
explicit. 
This 
paper 
has 
a 
threefold 
focus, 
the 
primary 
being 
explanation. 
The 
process 
of 
getting 
information 
about 
temporal 
components 
and 
reasoning 
with 
it 
is 
explained, 
leading 
to 
explanations 
of 
temporal 
information 
extraction, 
temporal 
knowledge 
representation 
and 
belief 
revision. 
Next 
to 
this 
the 
state 
of 
the 
art 
in 
each 
of 
these 
three 
areas 
is 
presented, 
and 
nally 
some 
possible 
paths 
for 
future 
research 
are 
presented. 


1 
Introduction 


We 
live 
in 
a 
world 
shaped 
by 
time. 
Everyone 
is 
familiar 
with 
it, 
be 
it 
on 
the 
level 
of 
days 
and 
seasons, 
or 
minutes 
and 
milliseconds. 
We 
understand 
that 
travel 
takes 
time, 
that 
the 
rain 
will 
eventually 
stop 
falling 
and 
that 
some 
things 
happened 
yesterday. 
These 
concepts 
all 
come 
natural 
to 
us 
because 
we 
use 
them 
every 
day 
and 
are 
used 
to 
events 
having 
a 
starting 
and 
end 
point. 


In 
written 
text, 
time 
references 
don't 
always 
have 
to 
be 
included. 
The 
sentence 
\Barack 
Obama 
was 
elected 
as 
President 
of 
the 
USA” 
points 
to 
the 
2012 
elections 
when 
used 
in 
november 
2012, 
but 
is 
ambiguous 
to 
which 
election 
is 
being 
referred 
to 
when 
used 
a 
long 
time 
from 
now. 
In 
a 
sense, 
the 
context 
of 
which 
timeperiod 
is 
being 
referred 
to, 
can 
be 
lost. 


Another 
aspect 
of 
written 
text 
is 
the 
implicit 
dated 
nature 
of 
the 
information 
contained 
in 
it. 
Readers 
can 
assertain 
that 
the 
information 
was 
believed 
by 
the 
author 
to 
be 
true 
at 
the 
time 
of 
writing, 
but 
they 
can't 
assume 
that 
it 
was 
factually 
true, 
and 
even 
less 
that 
it 
still 
is. 
Information 
and 
beliefs 
may 
be 
revisited 
based 
on 
new 
research 
or 
arguments, 
causing 
the 
written 
text 
to 
become 
inaccurate. 


Finally 
a 
notion 
of 
time 
is 
already 
implicitly 
present 
in 
several 
statements. 
\It's 



raining", 
\Alice 
is 
employed 
by 
Google” 
and 
\Bob 
lives 
in 
Delft” 
are 
good 
examples 
of 
this. 
The 
information 
contained 
in 
these 
sentences 
can 
and 
probably 
will 
change 
over 
the 
next 
hours 
or 
years, 
making 
representing 
a 
notion 
of 
time 
important 
when 
dealing 
with 
information. 


1.1 
Time 
on 
the 
Web 
On 
the 
web 
the 
need 
for 
representing 
time 
hardly 
diers 
from 
outside 
it. 
Information 
is 
still 
published 
at 
a 
certain 
date 
by 
a 
certain 
author, 
and 
can 
be 
outdated, 
become 
invalid, 
or 
need 
a 
time 
reference 
to 
make 
it 
meaningful. 
The 
way 
in 
which 
it 
diers 
is 
the 
accessibility 
of 
information. 
At 
one 
moment, 
users 
have 
access 
to 
millions 
of 
data 
sources, 
too 
much 
for 
them 
to 
browe 
or 
judge 
on 
validity 
themselves. 


The 
semantic 
web 
is 
a 
step 
forward 
in 
this 
regard, 
as 
it 
represents 
information 
in 
a 
way 
that 
lets 
computers 
determine 
how 
information 
relates 
to 
other 
information. 
Because 
of 
this, 
computers 
can 
traverse 
the 
web 
of 
semantic 
information, 
automatically 
drawing 
conclusions 
about 
information 
that 
can 
be 
deducted 
from 
other 
information 
that's 
already 
present. 
When 
time 
is 
factored 
in, 
it 
becomes 
a 
concern 
to 
automatically 
detect 
the 
timescope 
within 
wich 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
is 
valid, 
to 
be 
used 
in 
drawing 
the 
automated 
conclusions. 


Most 
of 
the 
data 
in 
the 
semantic 
web 
doesn't 
contain 
annotations 
about 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
information 
or 
relations. 
Moreover, 
as 
will 
also 
become 
apparent 
in 
section 
2.2, 
the 
binary 
tuples 
that 
are 
commonly 
used 
for 
dening 
semantic 
relations, 
aren't 
designed 
to 
contain 
information 
on 
when 
the 
semantic 
relation 
holds, 
and 
when 
it 
doesn't. 
However, 
when 
such 
annotations 
exist 
in 
the 
semantic 
web, 
reasoning 
about 
it 
can 
remain 
a 
challenge. 
For 
example, 
when 
can 
we 
say 
that 
information 
becomes 
outdated 
in 
the 
semantic 
web? 
And 
when 
information 
is 
automatically 
deducted 
from 
existing 
information, 
does 
it 
become 
invalid 
when 
the 
underlying 
information 
expires? 


The 
previous 
paragraphs 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
three 
elds 
of 
research 
to 
properly 
address 
this 
topic. 
In 
order 
of 
usage, 
these 
are: 


1. 
Temporal 
Information 
Extraction 
2. 
Temporal 
Modeling 
3. 
Belief 
Revision 
The 
rst 
eld 
of 
research 
is 
needed 
to 
get 
information 
about 
the 
timespan 
in 
which 
information 
is 
valid 
from 
the 
information 
source 
itself, 
mostly 
when 
automatically 
giving 
semantic 
annotations 
to 
previously 
unstructured 
text 
sources, 
like 
news 
articles 
or 
reviews. 
The 
second 
eld 
is 
needed 
for 
representing 
time 
and 
temporal 
relations 
on 
the 
semantic 
web, 
and 
can 
serve 
as 
a 
way 
for 
the 
rst 
research 
to 
shape 
the 
results. 
The 
third 
eld 
of 
research 
provides 
more 
high-level 
challenges 
for 
reasoning 
about 
information 
that 
has 
a 
temporal 
aspect, 
mostly 



concerning 
itself 
with 
consistency 
of 
the 
information 
and 
how 
to 
deduct 
new 
information 
or 
remove 
old 
information, 
based 
upon 
the 
temporal 
aspect. 


Together 
these 
three 
elds 
span 
dierent 
areas 
of 
computer 
science 
research: 
Information 
Retrieval, 
Semantic 
Web 
Modeling, 
and 
Articial 
Intelligence. 
For 
comprehending 
and 
fully 
appreciating 
the 
challenges 
of 
using 
time 
in 
the 
semantic, 
each 
of 
these 
three 
elds 
is 
important 
and 
as 
such 
all 
three 
will 
be 
reected 
upon 
in 
sections 
2 
and 
3. 


1.2 
Static 
and 
streaming 
data 
One 
more 
distinction 
can 
be 
made 
when 
discussing 
time 
on 
the 
web. 
The 
explanation 
until 
now 
assumed 
information 
to 
be 
available 
and 
static 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
it 
is 
slow 
to 
change, 
much 
like 
a 
news 
article 
on 
the 
web 
that 
will 
only 
change 
when 
it's 
conciously 
edited, 
which 
might 
happen 
a 
few 
times 
but 
isn't 
a 
continous 
process. 
However, 
some 
information 
is 
only 
useful 
in 
a 
stream 
of 
information, 
where 
each 
consecutive 
query 
produces 
a 
possible 
dierent 
result. 
Examples 
of 
this 
are 
the 
current 
stock 
prices, 
local 
weather 
conditions 
and 
trac 
jams. 
Monitoring 
such 
streams 
will 
give 
information 
that 
changes 
every 
second 
or 
minute. 
The 
elds 
of 
research 
of 
the 
previous 
section 
still 
apply 
to 
this 
problem, 
but 
need 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
a 
new 
direction. 
Reasoning 
over 
changing 
information 
seems 
mostly 
suitable 
for 
data 
that 
changes 
in 
low 
volumes 
at 
low 
frequency, 
making 
streaming 
data 
pose 
new 
challenges. 


Having 
outlined 
the 
dierent 
aspects 
of 
time 
on 
the 
web 
this 
paper 
will 
try 
to 
give 
an 
overview 
of 
the 
current 
state 
of 
the 
art 
in 
the 
three 
identied 
elds 
of 
research, 
for 
both 
types 
of 
data. 
The 
remainder 
of 
this 
paper 
is 
structured 
as 
follows. 
First 
in 
section 
2 
the 
concept 
of 
time 
for 
static 
information 
is 
explored 
thoroughly 
in 
all 
three 
elds 
of 
research. 
Afterwards, 
section 
3 
discusses 
the 
differences 
for 
these 
elds 
when 
comparing 
streaming 
to 
static 
information. 
Then 
in 
section 
4 
remaining 
challenges 
concerning 
time 
on 
the 
semantic 
web 
will 
be 
discussed 
to 
propose 
a 
direction 
for 
future 
research. 
Finally 
section 
5 
will 
give 
a 
short 
conclusion 
based 
on 
the 
presented 
material. 


2 
Static 
information 


Traditionally 
on 
the 
web 
all 
published 
information 
was 
static. 
Websites 
that 
publish 
content, 
be 
it 
user-generated, 
content 
from 
news 
media 
or 
semantically 
annotated 
knowledge, 
have 
a 
moment 
the 
information 
is 
published, 
after 
which 
the 
information 
stays 
available 
for 
a 
non-trivial 
amount 
of 
time. 
Because 
users 
can 
copy 
what 
they 
nd 
on 
the 
web, 
and 
because 
of 
eorts 
to 
preserve 
and 
archive 
the 
history 
of 
the 
web, 
information 
on 
the 
web 
has 
a 
chance 
of 
being 
saved 
and 
remaining 
accessible, 
even 
when 
the 
source 
has 
revoked 
the 
information 
or 
pages 
containing 
it. 


For 
dealing 
with 
time 
in 
static 
information 
on 
the 
web 
the 
three 
subjects 
already 
mentioned 
in 
section 
1 
will 
be 
discussed 
in 
more 
detail 
here. 



2.1 
Temporal 
information 
extraction 
The 
amount 
of 
information 
on 
the 
web 
continues 
to 
grow 
at 
an 
impressive 
rate. 
While 
for 
automated 
reasoning 
it 
would 
be 
most 
useful 
for 
this 
information 
to 
be 
published 
in 
RDF 
or 
OWL 
with 
semantic 
annotations, 
reality 
is 
that 
most 
of 
the 
information 
sources 
only 
provide 
text 
documents. 
Annotated 
information 
will 
be 
called 
structured 
information 
or 
text 
throughout 
the 
remainder 
of 
this 
paper, 
as 
opposed 
to 
unstructured 
information 
or 
unstructured 
text. 


With 
unstructured 
text 
being 
more 
prevalent 
on 
the 
web 
than 
structured 
text, 
the 
majority 
of 
information 
needs 
to 
be 
retrieved 
automatically 
from 
such 
texts. 
Information 
Retrieval 
methods 
can 
perform 
just 
this 
task. 
Almost 
all 
methods 
have 
a 
focus 
on 
extracting 
facts 
from 
text 
and 
encoding 
them 
as 
binary 
relations, 
without 
regard 
for 
the 
temporal 
aspects. 
This 
results 
in 
information 
being 
represented 
as 
time 
invariant 
facts, 
when 
the 
information 
at 
hand 
doesn't 
necessarily 
have 
to 
be. 


Where 
the 
eld 
of 
information 
retrieval 
already 
has 
proven 
methods 
for 
extracting 
meaning 
from 
text,[1][2] 
extracting 
time 
dependent 
relations 
next 
to 
the 
already 
retrieved 
information 
does 
not 
have 
such 
common 
solutions. 
To 
extract 
time 
dependent 
relations 
from 
unstructured 
text, 
several 
approaches 
have 
been 
suggested. 
These 
approaches 
focus 
on 
event 
extraction, 
where 
an 
event 
is 
dened 
as: 
\something 
that 
occurs 
in 
a 
certain 
place 
at 
a 
certain 
time."[3] 
This 
denition 
immediately 
provides 
a 
challenge, 
in 
the 
modeling 
of 
information 
that 
doesn't 
have 
a 
place 
or 
a 
clearly 
identied 
time. 
For 
instance 
the 
sentence 
\The 
Higgs-Boson 
has 
never 
been 
detected” 
is 
clearly 
time 
dependent, 
but 
extracting 
an 
event 
from 
this 
is 
not 
easily 
done. 
A 
possible 
solution 
is 
to 
use 
the 
document 
creation 
or 
modication 
date 
to 
describe 
an 
atomic 
time 
interval, 
a 
chronon, 
at 
which 
the 
information 
at 
hand 
was 
valid. 
When 
more 
clearly 
identied 
events 
(\Today 
scientists 
at 
CERN 
may 
have 
found 
the 
Higgs-Boson") 
are 
generated, 
automated 
reasoning 
can 
determine 
the 
certainty 
of 
the 
rst 
statement 
changes. 


For 
event 
extraction 
the 
unstructured 
text 
rst 
needs 
to 
be 
parsed 
using 
a 
syntactic 
parser 
to 
detect 
semantic 
roles 
for 
verbs 
contained 
in 
the 
text.[4] 
Then 
in 
the 
second 
step 
the 
temporal 
attributes 
of 
each 
sentence 
need 
to 
be 
classied, 
to 
properly 
detect 
types 
of 
events.[5] 
The 
tense 
of 
the 
sentence 
is 
important 
to 
classify 
when 
the 
event 
is, 
the 
modality 
describes 
whether 
it 
is 
something 
that 
happened, 
should 
happen, 
can 
happen 
or 
will 
not 
happen. 
And 
most 
important 
the 
event 
class 
needs 
to 
be 
identied, 
whether 
it 
concerns 
an 
action, 
an 
occurrance, 
a 
perception 
or 
another 
class, 
to 
properly 
give 
an 
event 
a 
semantic 
annotation. 
Then 
in 
the 
third 
step 
the 
temporal 
relation 
between 
two 
events 
needs 
to 
be 
chosen. 
Representing 
these 
time 
intervals 
will 
more 
thoroughly 
be 
discussed 
in 
the 
next 
section. 


As 
is 
apparent 
from 
the 
above 
discussion, 
most 
information 
extraction 
solutions 
don't 
automatically 
reason 
about 
the 
time 
dependence 
of 
information, 
but 



using 
event 
extraction 
is 
a 
step 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
that 
can 
even 
be 
used 
to 
reason 
about 
information 
with 
a 
modication 
date. 


2.2 
Semantic 
representation 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
explaining 
the 
core 
concepts 
and 
issues, 
this 
section 
will 
assume 
the 
information 
retrieval 
step 
to 
be 
solved 
and 
to 
be 
accurate, 
and 
will 
only 
focus 
on 
the 
end 
result 
of 
that 
step: 
representing 
time. 
The 
question 
dominating 
this 
section 
will 
be: 
how 
can 
we 
store 
the 
temporal 
annotation 
in 
a 
way 
that 
can 
be 
processed 
automatically? 
First 
the 
concept 
of 
time 
intervals 
is 
discussed, 
after 
which 
existing 
solutions 
to 
represent 
time 
on 
the 
semantic 
web 
are 
presented. 


Temporal 
Intervals 
In 
the 
semantic 
web 
the 
relation 
between 
two 
pieces 
of 
information 
is 
usually 
indicated 
by 
tuples 
containing 
the 
subject, 
the 
relation, 
and 
the 
object. 
For 
instance 
employedBy(Alice, 
Google) 
or 
more 
formally 
with 
the 
(ctious) 
namespaces 
from 
which 
the 
three 
parts 
of 
the 
tuple 
can 
be 
known, 
fperson:Alice 
work:employedBy 
company:Googleg. 
Time 
can 
be 
represented 
in 
the 
same 
way, 
noting 
the 
temporal 
relation 
between 
events 
or 
two 
time 
dependent 
pieces 
of 
information. 
For 
this 
to 
work, 
each 
event 
or 
information 
already 
needs 
to 
have 
a 
temporal 
annotation 
of 
when 
it 
happened, 
or 
an 
interval 
when 
it 
was 
valid. 


For 
most 
publications 
the 
13 
time 
interval 
relations 
rst 
published 
by 
Allen 


[6] 
are 
used, 
as 
displayed 
in 
gure 
1. 
These 
intervals 
can 
be 
reasoned 
about 
and 
propagated, 
so 
if 
for 
example 
A 
STARTS 
B, 
and 
B 
MEET 
C, 
then 
it 
can 
be 
concluded 
that 
A 
BEFORE 
C. 
Dening 
such 
interval 
relations 
for 
static 
information 
as 
opposed 
to 
events 
can 
pose 
a 
challenge, 
because 
information 
usually 
has 
no 
dened 
end 
time, 
making 
it 
either 
a 
single 
point 
in 
time, 
leading 
to 
only 
BEFORE, 
iBEFORE 
and 
EQUAL 
relations, 
or 
a 
timespan 
that 
has 
started 
at 
a 
dened 
point 
but 
doesn't 
end, 
excluding 
the 
BEFORE, 
MEET, 
OVERLAP, 
DURING 
and 
START 
relations. 


Temporal 
OWL 
For 
representing 
temporal 
information 
in 
the 
Web 
Ontology 
Language, 
an 
important 
distinction 
needs 
to 
be 
made, 
between 
events 
and 
nonevents. 
Information 
describing 
an 
event 
has 
a 
clear 
begin 
and 
end 
date, 
as 
it 
is 
already 
dened 
that 
events 
happen 
at 
a 
certain 
time 
or 
during 
a 
certain 
time 
interval. 
For 
non-events 
the 
begin 
and 
end 
are 
much 
less 
clear, 
as 
could 
already 
be 
deducted 
from 
the 
previous 
sections. 


Moreover, 
the 
semantic 
annotations 
themselves 
are 
also 
examples 
of 
the 
information 
under 
study. 
How 
can 
a 
semantic 
relation 
be 
modeled 
that 
is 
only 
true 
or 
false 
depending 
on 
when 
it's 
used? 
A 
problem 
here 
is 
that 
triples 
are 
used 
for 
representing 
the 
semantic 
information, 
and 
there's 
no 
way 
to 
give 
a 
subject, 
a 
relation 
and 
an 
object 
in 
a 
triple 
that 
also 
mentions 
the 
time 
interval 
during 
which 
the 
triple 
holds.[7] 
A 
way 
in 
which 
this 
can 
be 
solved 
without 
resolving 



Fig. 
1. 
The 
possible 
13 
primitive 
time 
relationships 
between 
2 
intervals 
[9] 


to 
quadruples 
instead 
of 
triples, 
would 
be 
to 
create 
a 
new 
object 
and 
triple 
for 
every 
semantic 
relation, 
creating 
a 
triple 
like: 
holds(aliceEmployedAtGoogle, 
2010-2012). 
This 
obviously 
is 
not 
a 
preferred 
solution, 
because 
of 
the 
immense 
overhead 
incurred 
by 
it. 
However, 
it 
is 
a 
solution 
that 
adheres 
to 
the 
design 
principles 
of 
OWL. 


Several 
approaches 
have 
been 
taken 
to 
representing 
time 
in 
OWL. 
First 
o, 
Tao 
describes 
a 
way 
to 
encapsulate 
clinical 
narratives 
in 
RDF 
triples, 
using 
a 
DateTime 
object 
for 
signaling 
the 
moment 
of 
an 
observation 
of 
symptom 
and 
a 
granularity 
measure 
indicating 
the 
timespan 
within 
which 
this 
information 
was 
deemed 
to 
be 
accurate.[8] 
For 
example 
taking 
antibiotics 
is 
modeled 
as 
something 
that 
happened 
in 
a 
timespan 
of 
10 
days, 
with 
a 
granularity 
(accuracy) 
of 
one 
day. 


Batsakis 
gives 
an 
overview 
of 
ways 
to 
represent 
time 
in 
OWL, 
mentioning 
the 
restrictions 
above.[10] 
When 
considering 
extending 
OWL 
syntax 
and 
semantics 
with 
the 
additional 
constructs 
that 
are 
needed, 
Batsakis 
discusses 
uses 
Tempora
l 
Description 
Logics, 
extending 
Temporal 
RDF, 
versioning, 
and 
the 
4D-Fluent 
approach 
which 
will 
be 
discussed 
in 
the 
next 
section. 
The 
main 
contribution 
of 
Batsakis 
is 
SOWL, 
an 
ontology 
model 
that 
can 
handle 
spatio-temporal 
infor



mation, 
as 
an 
extension 
of 
OWL, 
also 
providing 
a 
querying 
model 
and 
rules 
for 
automated 
reasoning 
in 
SOWL. 


Finally 
Milea 
et 
al. 
has 
designed 
the 
tOWL 
language, 
using 
a 
layered 
approach 
to 
express 
domains, 
temporal 
representations 
and 
timeslices.[11][12] 
This 
approach 
is 
also 
based 
on 
extending 
description 
logics 
with 
a 
temporal 
representation, 
like 
the 
previous 
one. 
Using 
timeslices, 
which 
will 
also 
be 
discussed 
in 
the 
next 
section, 
the 
overhead 
that 
is 
inherently 
recurred 
from 
adding 
temporal 
values 
in 
the 
binary 
semantic 
relations, 
can 
be 
reduced 
but 
at 
the 
cost 
of 
increasing 
granularity. 


Fluents 
As 
already 
mentioned 
several 
times, 
OWL 
only 
allows 
binary 
relations, 
or 
3-dimensional 
tuples, 
to 
indicate 
relations 
between 
two 
objects. 
In 
modeling 
time, 
objects 
and 
relationships 
are 
discovered 
that 
vary 
with 
time. 
The 
time 
the 
relationship 
holds 
needs 
to 
be 
dened 
explicitly, 
and 
as 
such 
requires 
another 
argument. 
These 
relationships 
that 
vary 
over 
time 
are 
called 
uents. 


After 
considering 
the 
standard 
OWL-and 
RDF-based 
approaches 
to 
represent 
uents, 
Welty 
proposes 
a 
four-dimensional 
(4D) 
view 
to 
account 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
same 
relation 
or 
entity 
can 
be 
dierent 
at 
other 
times.[7] 
This 
view 
is 
based 
on 
the 
idea 
that 
all 
entities 
are 
perdurants, 
entities 
that 
have 
temporal 
parts 
that 
exist 
during 
the 
times 
the 
entity 
exists. 
This 
becomes 
a 
logical 
view 
when 
events 
and 
information 
are 
viewed 
on 
a 
universal 
scale; 
in 
the 
millions 
of 
years 
the 
universe 
exists, 
even 
the 
lifetime 
of 
a 
human 
being 
is 
an 
insignicant 
time 
interval, 
making 
all 
entities 
represented 
in 
the 
semantic 
web 
not 
much 
dierent. 
A 
single 
entity 
would 
in 
this 
4D 
view 
be 
an 
entity 
that 
at 
each 
point 
in 
time 
can 
have 
other 
aspects. 
The 
entity 
\Bob” 
could 
have 
a 
dierent 
height 
at 
time 
interval 
t1 
than 
at 
time 
interval 
t2. 


This 
view 
on 
reality 
has 
the 
possibility 
for 
confusing 
what 
is 
exactly 
meant 
by 
sentences 
that 
previously 
oered 
no 
problem 
to 
process. 
The 
sentence 
\Eve 
is 
ying 
to 
Amsterdam” 
would 
in 
the 
4D 
view 
be 
expressed 
as 
\A 
temporal 
part 
of 
Eve 
is 
ying 
to 
a 
temporal 
part 
of 
Amsterdam.” 
However, 
this 
approach 
has 
a 
practical 
use: 
it 
can 
represents 
each 
entity 
at 
a 
specic 
point 
in 
time, 
without 
confusing 
which 
entity 
is 
being 
discussed. 
The 
earlier 
example 
of 
employedBy(Alice, 
Google) 
would 
be 
expanded 
to 
employedBy(Alice@t1, 
Google@t1), 
to 
properly 
include 
the 
time 
intervals. 


Batsakis 
uses 
this 
view 
and 
expands 
upon 
it, 
dening 
new 
ontological 
classes 
TimeSlice 
and 
TimeInterval, 
with 
properties 
tsTimeSliceOf 
and 
tsTimeInterval
.[13] 
The 
idea 
behind 
this 
is 
that 
for 
every 
previously 
dened 
object 
X, 
timesliced 
objects 
can 
be 
created 
with 
fX@t1 
tsTimeSliceOf 
X} 
holding. 
For 
the 
time 
intervals 
the 
thirteen 
relations 
already 
seen 
in 
gure 
1 
can 
be 
used 
for 
dening 
temporal 
relations 
between 
two 
timeslices 
and 
reasoning 
about 
it. 



2.3 
Belief 
revision 
The 
third 
eld 
of 
research 
needed 
for 
temporal 
information 
on 
the 
web 
is 
belief 
revision, 
which 
mostly 
concerns 
itself 
with 
Articial 
Intelligence 
(AI) 
systems, 
and 
the 
traditional 
representation 
of 
knowledge 
in 
belief 
systems. 
This 
eld 
is 
largely 
unexplored 
for 
the 
Semantic 
Web, 
so 
in 
this 
section 
the 
concepts 
that 
could 
also 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
semantic 
web 
will 
be 
discussed, 
to 
further 
understanding 
of 
the 
complexity 
of 
representing 
and 
dealing 
with 
time. 


Belief 
revision 
deals 
with 
inconsistencies 
in 
knowledge. 
Assume 
that 
you 
have 
the 
following 
knowledge 
rules. 


1. 
Birds 
can 
y 
2. 
Penguins 
are 
birds 
3. 
Penguins 
can 
not 
y 
Suppose 
that 
it 
is 
a 
given 
that 
X 
is 
a 
bird, 
then 
the 
knowledge 
that 
X 
can 
y 
would 
be 
automatically 
inferred. 
If 
at 
a 
later 
time 
the 
knowledge 
would 
be 
added 
that 
X 
is 
a 
penguin, 
the 
knowledge 
that 
X 
can 
not 
y 
would 
be 
automatically 
inferred, 
leading 
to 
an 
inconsistent 
knowledge 
state. 


Roughly 
the 
same 
happens 
on 
the 
semantic 
web. 
Both 
RDF 
and 
OWL, 
which 
lie 
at 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
semantic 
web, 
dene 
how 
to 
arrive 
at 
new 
information 
by 
reasoning 
from 
given 
information.[14] 
This 
immediately 
includes 
the 
need 
for 
consistency 
maintenance, 
or 
belief 
revision, 
when 
conicting 
information 
is 
created. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
here 
that 
conicting 
information 
in 
the 
semantic 
web 
seems 
prima 
facie 
a 
case 
of 
incorrect 
information 
or 
incorrect 
semantic 
relations, 
as 
is 
assumed 
by 
Vilain 
when 
talking 
about 
constraints 
for 
temporal 
relations.[15] 
However, 
given 
that 
semantic 
relations 
can 
be 
uent, 
it 
could 
have 
been 
the 
case 
of 
a 
semantic 
relation 
holding 
at 
the 
rst 
moment 
when 
new 
information 
was 
inferred 
and 
not 
holding 
at 
the 
second 
moment 
when 
con
icting 
information 
was 
inferred. 
This 
forces 
traditional 
reasoning 
schemes 
for 
conicting 
information 
in 
the 
semantic 
web 
to 
need 
rethinking. 


The 
Frame 
Problem 
The 
consistency 
issues 
mentioned 
above 
can 
be 
summarized 
in 
the 
frame 
problem: 
During 
which 
timeframe 
does 
a 
certain 
piece 
of 
information 
hold. 
For 
information 
about 
actions 
and 
events 
this 
can 
already 
be 
modeled, 
concluding 
that 
after 
goTo(Alice, 
Kitchen), 
the 
information 
at(Alice, 
Kitchen) 
must 
hold.[16] 
However, 
does 
position(Alice,sitting) 
still 
hold 
after 
the 
rst 
action? 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
frame 
problem 
also 
asks 
how 
to 
represent 
everything 
that 
does 
not 
change, 
when 
performing 
an 
action. 
Lifschitz 
gives 
several 
possibilities 
in 
the 
form 
of 
rules, 
such 
as 
\what 
holds 
in 
a 
situation 
typically 
holds 
in 
the 
situation 
after 
an 
action 
was 
performed, 
unless 
it 
contradicts 
the 
description 
of 
the 
eects 
of 
the 
action.” 


In 
related 
work, 
Gupta 
already 
proposed 
to 
revise 
beliefs 
by 
deleting 
the 
knowledge 
tuples 
that 
can 
be 
aected 
by 
an 
action, 
then 
rederiving 
some 
of 
them, 



insofar 
possible.[17] 
This 
is 
further 
enhanced 
by 
a 
counting 
algorithm 
that 
keeps 
track 
of 
the 
number 
of 
nonrecursive 
derivations, 
to 
aid 
the 
deleting 
and 
rederiving. 
This 
seems 
a 
solution 
on 
the 
side 
of 
caution, 
preferring 
deleting 
correctly 
inferred 
and 
still 
valid 
information 
over 
keeping 
outdated 
information. 


Gardenfors 
denes 
three 
types 
of 
belief 
revisions, 
happening 
at 
expansion, 
revision 
or 
contraction.[18] 
Expansion 
happens 
when 
new 
beliefs 
are 
added 
to 
a 
system, 
revision 
happens 
when 
new 
inconsistent 
beliefs 
are 
added 
and 
several 
old 
beliefs 
are 
deleted 
to 
maintain 
consistency, 
and 
contraction 
happens 
when 
some 
belief 
is 
removed 
without 
adding 
any 
new 
facts. 
The 
last 
two 
revisions 
can 
cause 
additional 
problems, 
most 
having 
to 
do 
with 
information 
that 
was 
inferred 
from 
a 
belief 
that 
was 
removed. 
It 
can 
happen 
that 
the 
inferred 
information 
is 
still 
valid, 
while 
the 
reasons 
for 
assuming 
so 
are 
not. 
This 
leads 
to 
the 
following 
question. 
\How 
to 
determine 
which 
information 
remains 
unaected, 
when 
related 
information 
becomes 
outdated.” 
For 
answering 
this 
methods 
from 
Lifschitz[16] 
or 
Gupta[17] 
can 
be 
used 
to 
return 
to 
a 
consistent 
knowledge 
state 
if 
needed. 


3 
Streaming 
information 


As 
already 
briey 
talked 
about 
in 
the 
introduction, 
not 
all 
information 
and 
beliefs 
are 
static 
in 
the 
sense 
that 
their 
value 
is 
preserved 
for 
some 
period 
of 
time. 
Information 
can 
also 
be 
streaming, 
meaning 
that 
it 
changes 
continually 
and 
that 
two 
consecutive 
queries 
on 
the 
same 
data 
source 
will 
give 
dierent 
results. 
Several 
good 
examples 
of 
this 
are 
click-streams, 
sensor 
networks, 
trac 
monitoring, 
and 
the 
stock 
market, 
where 
stocks 
uctuate 
by 
tiny 
amounts 
several 
times 
every 
second.[19] 
This 
last 
example 
clearly 
outlines 
the 
dierence 
in 
streaming 
information 
when 
compared 
to 
static 
information. 
Not 
only 
is 
there 
new 
information 
every 
second, 
but 
the 
information 
from 
just 
a 
second 
ago 
has 
become 
irrelevant 
with 
the 
new 
information 
that 
is 
streaming 
in. 


These 
characteristics 
bring 
about 
new 
issues 
and 
goals 
for 
reasoning 
about 
time. 
First 
o, 
the 
time 
constraints 
are 
much 
tighter. 
In 
real 
time 
results 
or 
actions 
have 
to 
be 
calculated 
because 
with 
signicant 
delay 
the 
chosen 
actions 
will 
not 
make 
sense 
anymore, 
given 
the 
new 
current 
state 
of 
the 
system. 
Secondly 
a 
distinction 
needs 
to 
be 
made 
between 
knowledge 
that 
does 
not 
change 
based 
upon 
rapidly 
changing 
observations, 
knowledge 
that 
does 
change 
periodically 
and 
knowledge 
that 
changes 
based 
on 
events 
following 
from 
the 
streaming 
data.[19] 
The 
distinction 
between 
knowledge 
and 
data 
is 
needed 
because 
the 
datastream 
is 
said 
to 
continuously 
change, 
while 
the 
beliefs 
a 
system 
has 
do 
not 
necessarily 
have 
to 
change 
as 
well. 


The 
three 
elds 
of 
research 
identied 
for 
time 
in 
the 
semantic 
web 
are 
also 
aected 
by 
stream 
reasoning, 
although 
the 
core 
of 
the 
explanation 
in 
the 
previous 
sections 
still 
holds. 
In 
the 
following 
paragraphs 
the 
main 
dierences 
and 
additional 
challenges 
will 
be 
mentioned, 
when 
comparing 
streaming 
information 
to 
more 
static 
information. 



Temporal 
information 
extraction 
First 
o, 
information 
retrieval 
is 
made 
easier, 
because 
streaming 
information 
is 
usually 
already 
encoded 
in 
a 
specied 
format, 
such 
as 
RSS 
feeds. 
Extracting 
temporal 
meaning 
is 
trivial 
here, 
because 
each 
data 
point 
only 
represents 
the 
current 
situation 
and 
doesn't 
hold 
over 
a 
longer 
timespan. 
Next 
to 
these 
two 
aspects, 
for 
reasoning 
about 
data 
streams 
this 
topic 
stays 
the 
same 
as 
already 
presented 
in 
section.2.1 


Semantic 
representation 
Valle 
proposes 
that 
data 
streams 
can 
always 
be 
considered 
RDF 
streams. 
Two 
formats 
are 
given, 
being 
RDF 
Molecules 
stream 
and 
RDF 
statements 
stream. 
The 
rst 
one 
is 
a 
bag 
of 
pairs 
containing 
a 
RDF 
molecule 
and 
a 
timestamp, 
the 
second 
one 
is 
a 
special 
case 
of 
the 
rst 
where 
bag 
of 
pairs 
contains 
RDF 
statements 
instead 
of 
molecules. 


Reasoning 
about 
semantic 
relationships 
between 
molecules 
in 
this 
RDF 
data 
is 
tough, 
because 
of 
some 
diculties.[20] 
First 
o, 
every 
stream 
is 
observed 
through 
a 
window, 
limiting 
the 
timespan 
and 
possibly 
lacking 
information 
or 
containing 
conicting 
information 
when 
two 
consecutive 
readings 
from 
one 
sensor 
are 
processed. 
The 
second 
diculty 
is 
that 
while 
the 
stream 
information 
changes 
continuously, 
data 
might 
be 
correlated 
and 
merged 
with 
static 
information. 
When 
semantic 
relations 
are 
generated 
with 
static 
information, 
this 
creates 
data 
that 
must 
be 
carefully 
managed 
to 
account 
for 
the 
continuous 
changes 
in 
the 
object 
at 
one 
side 
of 
the 
semantic 
relation. 


Belief 
revision 
Even 
more 
challenges 
arise 
for 
belief 
revision 
in 
stream 
reasoning. 
One 
is 
that 
the 
stream 
can 
only 
be 
accessed 
while 
it 
ows, 
making 
it 
impossible 
to 
reconstruct 
inferred 
information 
at 
a 
later 
time, 
for 
checking 
internal 
consistency. 
Finally 
inferring 
new 
information 
based 
upon 
streams 
is 
dicult 
because 
at 
every 
two 
moments 
two 
conicting 
readings 
from 
sensors 
can 
be 
gathered, 
making 
it 
tough 
to 
reason 
about 
the 
current 
validity 
of 
either 
reading. 
Remaining 
questions 
are, 
for 
example, 
how 
to 
include 
real-time 
streaming 
information 
into 
querying 
languages 
for 
semantic 
information, 
such 
as 
SPARQL, 
and 
a 
vocabulary 
to 
give 
meaningful 
assertments 
on 
the 
future 
validity 
of 
information, 
when 
given 
a 
streaming 
information 
source. 


4 
Future 
Work 


The 
previous 
sections 
have 
discussed 
the 
three 
elds 
of 
research 
needed 
for 
using 
time 
on 
the 
semantic 
web, 
giving 
more 
questions 
than 
answers 
in 
some 
regards. 
For 
retrieving 
temporal 
information, 
how 
can 
the 
temporal 
reach 
of 
a 
piece 
of 
information 
be 
determined? 
No 
clear 
distinction 
between 
events 
and 
other 
information 
is 
currently 
made, 
or 
rather, 
research 
focuses 
on 
events 
as 
temporal 
entities, 
ignoring 
other 
information 
as 
such. 
Also, 
while 
the 
question 
\what 
informatio
n 
is 
contained 
in 
this 
sentence” 
is 
commonly 
answered 
by 
information 
retrieval 
techniques, 
the 
question 
\what 
information 
is 
still 
accurate 
in 
this 
sentence
” 
is 
left 
alone. 
Partly 
this 
is 
a 
question 
for 
Articial 
Intelligence 
as 
well, 



when 
concerning 
belief 
revision. 
However, 
most 
AI 
systems 
accept 
new 
knowledge 
without 
question, 
unless 
it 
leads 
to 
inconsistencies. 
At 
the 
very 
least 
the 
following 
makes 
an 
interesting 
research 
question 
for 
future 
research: 


– 
RQ1: 
How 
can 
be 
determined 
if 
information 
is 
still 
relevant, 
upon 
retrieving 
it? 
Dealing 
with 
information 
in 
the 
semantic 
representation 
of 
time 
also 
remains 
dicult, 
related 
to 
RQ1. 
When 
information 
doesn't 
have 
a 
time 
interval 
during 
which 
it 
holds, 
can 
it 
be 
said 
to 
be 
true 
before 
or 
after 
other 
information? 
How 
can 
information 
without 
a 
clear 
end 
time 
for 
its 
validity 
be 
modeled 
in 
the 
temporal 
ontologies 
and 
the 
4D 
uents 
approach 
that 
were 
presented? 
It 
seems 
a 
good 
idea 
that 
information 
becomes 
less 
certain 
when 
older, 
and 
this 
can 
be 
summarized 
in 
the 
following 
question 
for 
future 
work. 


– 
RQ2: 
How 
to 
represent 
temporal 
intervals 
only 
having 
a 
starting 
point, 
with 
decreasing 
chance 
of 
validity 
with 
progressing 
time? 
Finally 
belief 
revision 
is 
a 
concept 
well 
thought 
through 
for 
static 
information, 
but 
for 
stream 
reasoning 
and 
time-dependent 
information 
it's 
still 
lacking. 
The 
rst 
question 
that 
remained 
after 
the 
explanation 
above 
was 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
information 
that 
was 
inferred 
based 
upon 
information 
that 
has 
become 
invalid 
since. 
Secondly 
in 
explaining 
streaming 
information 
the 
formalizations 
of 
querying 
language 
extensions 
and 
vocabularies 
for 
expressing 
aspects 
of 
the 
information 
stream 
are 
still 
lacking. 
While 
this 
might 
only 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
time 
making 
the 
following 
questions 
redundant, 
they 
nonetheless 
need 
answering 
to 
further 
this 
eld 
of 
research. 


– 
RQ3: 
How 
to 
determine 
which 
semantically 
inferred 
information 
remains 
unaected, 
when 
related 
information 
becomes 
outdated? 
– 
RQ4: 
How 
to 
represent 
access 
to 
streaming 
data 
in 
querying 
languages 
for 
semantic 
information? 
– 
RQ5: 
How 
to 
assert 
the 
future 
validity 
of 
static 
data 
inuenced 
by 
streaming 
information? 
5 
Conclusions 


A 
comprehensive 
explanation 
of 
dierent 
aspects 
of 
time 
on 
the 
semantic 
web 
was 
presented, 
putting 
it 
together 
with 
research 
from 
the 
information 
retrieval 
and 
articial 
intelligence 
elds 
to 
give 
a 
complete 
view 
of 
complexities 
when 
discussing 
this 
topic. 
While 
the 
research 
on 
representing 
temporal 
semantic 
relations 
is 
ongoing, 
the 
research 
on 
belief 
revision 
for 
temporal 
data 
and 
stream 
reasoning 
seems 
to 
only 
have 
started 
in 
recent 
years. 
For 
information 
retrieval 
however, 
no 
research 
is 
currently 
being 
done 
into 
representing 
time-dependent 
knowledge 
and 
determining 
future 
validity 
of 
semantic 
relations. 
The 
research 
questions 
provided 
in 
section 
4 
can 
provide 
directions 
for 
future 
research 
to 
address 
the 
identied 
problems, 
hopefully 
leading 
to 
a 
semantic 
web 
where 
time 
is 
just 
as 
much 
ubiquitous 
as 
in 
our 
everyday 
world.
