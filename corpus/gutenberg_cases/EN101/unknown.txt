@United Kingdom  (Europe)

Introduction ::United Kingdom




Background:


The United Kingdom has historically played a leading role in
developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing literature and
science. At its zenith in the 19th century, the British Empire
stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The first half of
the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously depleted in two
World Wars and the Irish republic withdraw from the union. The
second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and the UK
rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European nation. As
one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, a founding
member of NATO, and of the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a global
approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member of the
EU, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and Monetary
Union. The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and
the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999. The latter
was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the peace
process, but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.
